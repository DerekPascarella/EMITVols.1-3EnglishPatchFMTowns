<h2>About the Game</h2>

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/EMITVols.1-3EnglishPatchFMTowns/blob/main/images/08.png?raw=true">"EMIT" is an educational visual-sound novel adventure, developed and published by Koei. It was created to help Japanese players study English, and was originally released in 1994 across platforms like FM Towns, Macintosh, Windows, PC-9801, SEGA Saturn, Super Famicom, 3DO, and PlayStation.
<br><br>
It is divided into three volumes, all written by Jiro Akagawa.
<br><br>
• EMIT Vol. 1: Lost in Time
<br>
• EMIT Vol. 2: Desperate Journey
<br>
• EMIT Vol. 3: Bid Myself Farewell
<br><br>
The plot revolves around a world where people age backwards, and is both a storyline-driven visual novel and a language learning tool, though the latter of these characteristics is irrelevant for purposes of this patch.
<br><br>
<img align="left" width="300" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/EMITVols.1-3EnglishPatchFMTowns/blob/main/images/04.png?raw=true">The games blend a time travel mystery with real voice acting. Volume 1 starts the chain of strange events and pulls you into a world where past and present overlap. Volume 2 raises the stakes as you chase answers across places and times, meeting new allies and threats. Volume 3 brings the threads together in a fast paced finale that tests what you have learned and the bonds you have formed.
<br><br>
Each of the three volumes also includes its own unique side game (labeled "English Game" in the main menu), offering a fun pick-up-and-play experience to players outside of the game's story mode.
<br><br>
It's important to note that while "EMIT" was originally designed as an English learning tool for Japanese speakers, with this patch it can now be enjoyed simply as a set of three standalone games, each featuring beautiful artwork, full voice acting, and an engaging story.
